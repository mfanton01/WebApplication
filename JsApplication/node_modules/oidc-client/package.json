Then include it in your build.\r\n\r\n##### CommonJS\r\nIf you don't use a package manager or a module loader, then you can get the library from the `dist` folder on github [here](dist).\r\n\r\n## Including in the browser\r\n\r\nIf you intend to use this library directly in a browser and are not using UMD/AMD then there is a compiled version in the [~/dist](dist) folder. \r\nIt is already bundled/minified and contains the necessary dependencies and polyfills (mainly for ES6 features such as Promises).\r\n\r\nIf you are using UMD/AMD and/or you already have included an ES6 polyfill (such as babel-polyfill.js) then you can include the UMD packaged version of the file from the [~/lib](lib) folder.\r\n\r\n## Building the Source\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit clone https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js.git\r\ncd oidc-client-js\r\nnpm install\r\nnpm run build\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Running the Sample\r\n\r\n`npm start`\r\n\r\nand then browse to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000).\r\n\r\n## Running the Tests\r\n\r\n`npm test`\r\n\r\n## Docs\r\n\r\nSome initial docs are [here](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/wiki).\r\n\r\n## Feedback, Feature requests, and Bugs\r\n\r\nAll are welcome on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/IdentityModel/oidc-client-js/issues).\r\n",
